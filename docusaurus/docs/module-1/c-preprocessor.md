title: The C Preprocessor
---

The C preprocessor is a crucial component of the C language, performing tasks before the actual code compilation.

### Overview

The C language, dating back to 1972, relies heavily on the preprocessor. It handles tasks such as linking standard files and macro expansion.

### Preprocessor Commands

Preprocessor commands are indicated by the `#` character at the beginning of a line.

#### `#include`

The `#include` directive is used to include standard or user-defined header files.
```c
#include <stdio.h> // Standard header file
#include "mycode.h" // User-defined header file
```
- Standard headers are enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`) and searched in standard directories.
- User-defined headers are enclosed in double quotes (`""`) and searched in the local directory.

#### `#define`

The `#define` directive is used to define constants and macros.
```c
#define PI 3.14159
#define MAXINT 2147483647
#define EOF -1
```
- Constants are often written in uppercase.
- Macros can also be defined for syntactic sugar or convenience.
```c
#define SQ(x) ((x) * (x))
```
- This macro squares a number, ensuring correct precedence with parentheses.

### Example Usage

Here’s an example of using the preprocessor in a C program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define SPEED_OF_LIGHT 299792 // Speed of light in km/s

int main() {
    printf("The speed of light is %d km/s\n", SPEED_OF_LIGHT);
    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced Macros

Macros can be used for more complex operations, but they should be used with caution due to potential pitfalls.
```c
#define EQ(a, b) ((a) == (b)) // Logical equality

if (EQ(x, y)) {
    // Code
}
```
- This macro avoids common mistakes like using `=` instead of `==`.

### Pitfalls of Macros

Improper use of macros can lead to unexpected behavior due to operator precedence.
```c
#define SQUARE(x) (x * x)

int result = SQUARE(y + 3); // Incorrect expansion: y + 3 * y + 3
```
- Correct expansion should use parentheses:
```c
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
```

### Exploring Macros

To explore macro expansions, use the `-E` flag with your compiler to see the preprocessed output.
