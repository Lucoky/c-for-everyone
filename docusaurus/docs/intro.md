## Welcome

This course, "C for Everyone: Structured Programming," builds on the earlier course "C for Everyone: Fundamentals." Here's what you need to know coming into this class.

### Getting Started

There are several ways to have reached this point. You might have previously studied from the textbook *A Book on C*, covering roughly the first six chapters. If you completed the Coursera course *C for Everyone: Fundamentals*, you are exactly where you need to be.

Alternatively, a basic understanding of Java or Python can also be helpful, as many elements are similar to those in C. If you are new to C, you can quickly catch up by reviewing some basic elements.

### Prerequisites

You should know how to use a compiler and editor. Common tools include the GNU C compiler and editors like VI or Vim, but there are many other options.

### Lexical Elements

Understanding the language's lexical elements is crucial. These include:
- Identifiers
- Constants
- Operators
- Punctuation
- Keywords
- Comments

### Data Types

Programs operate on data types. Key types in C include:
- Integer types
- Floating point types (float and double)
- Character type (char)

### Flow of Control

Flow control structures are essential for making programs functional. These include:
- Compound statements
- While and for loops
- Conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)

### Functions

Functions are a central organizing concept in C. The main function is where the program starts, but subroutines or subfunctions help organize larger code. Functions should be concise and have arguments passed by value.

### Advanced Topics

The fundamentals course covered arrays, pointers, and strings. Arrays handle large amounts of data, and pointers are related to indexing. Strings in C are treated as arrays of characters.

### Sorting Algorithms

Familiarity with sorting algorithms like merge sort, bubble sort, or quick sort is expected, as they demonstrate command of arrays and iteration.

### Moving Forward

Review any necessary material, and prepare for more advanced topics. This course will cover creating new data types and writing larger programs by properly structuring them.
